Hi Gophers! Unfortunately, I don't have the time to maintain this library right now, so I can't add any features. I'll gladly accept pull requests if you're interested. Also, if you'd like to maintaining the library longer term, I'm also happy to welcome you as a contributor. If you're interested in either submitting a PR or being a longer term maintainer, please let me know on the [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/). My username there is `arschles`.

If you're looking for a more well maintained SQL query library that's written in a functional style similar to this one, please check out [pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop). It's very well designed and maintained, and has wonderful and capable engineers working on it.
